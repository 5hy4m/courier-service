Hii,

    I have created the courier service cli application using python

    I have used offers.json to store the predefined offers and we can add more offers by simply adding more offer objects to the json file

    I have written unit tests for almost all the functions

    I have used all prebuilt python packages so we don't need to install any third party packages

    Have to run this command to get started "python main.py" in the root folder

    navigate to test folder "python test_xxxx.py" to run tests
        python test_offer.py
        python test_package.py
        python test_vehicle.py
        python test_package_manager.py
